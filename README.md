Live: http://52.azurewebsites.net/FiftyTwoCards.html

This project is a coding challange. The challange: to create a deck of 52 playing cards that can be sorted and reset. Futher to provide automated testing.

I decided to complete this project in JavaScript as I knew I could create the program rapidly there and see the results in a very visual way.

Note: coding of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS was the easier part of this process.  As I am brand new to doing automated testing for JavaScript, learning enough Jasmine to create my tests was the more challenging part.  I found a simple video on you tube that was a big help.

Personal Goal: Practice with Object Oriented JavaScript where possible.
