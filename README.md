# FiftyTwoCards
Display 52 Cards.  Allow Shuffle &amp; Reset

This project is a coding challange sent by ShiftWise as part of their candidate review process.

I decided to complete this project in JavaScript as I knew I could create the program rapidly there and see the results in a very visual way.

I know that if I wanted to spend more time on it, it might be fun to actally create a Card class and encapsulate more logic there as opposed to using extra global arrays. <<Complete 5/12/2017>>

Note: coding of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS was the easier part of this process.  As I am brand new to doing automated testing for JavaScript, learning enough Jasmine to create my tests was the more challenging part.  I found a simple video on you tube that was a big help.

Thanks for reviewing my project.
